# AI-Assisted Software Engineering Guide

A methodology for building production-ready apps with AI — systematically, not randomly.

## What This Is

A structured approach to AI-assisted development that prevents the common failure pattern: spending thousands on tokens and ending up with broken code.

**The process:**

1. **Brainstorm with Claude Opus** in a Project — real multi-turn conversation about scope, tech stack, architecture
2. **Generate foundation documents** — README, Architecture (with real schemas), iron-clad rules, sprint plans, task specs
3. **Execute in focused tasks** — one task per conversation, plan mode first, test after, confidence score
4. **Know when to start fresh** — side tasks, circular debugging, long conversations → write a task doc, new conversation
5. **Audit between phases** — fresh AI reviews code, fixes before continuing

## Quick Start

### Just Want Templates?

Copy `project-templates/` into your repo. It includes:
- README, ARCHITECTURE, LEARNINGS templates
- `.clinerules` and `CLAUDE.md` with strict quality rules
- Task template, sprint plan template, sprint rules
- Prompt templates for every phase (brainstorming, doc generation, debugging, audits)

### Want to Learn the Methodology?

1. Read the [Introduction](/docs/introduction.md)
2. Understand [the philosophy](/docs/part-1/philosophy.md)
3. Choose [your tools](/docs/part-1/tool-selection.md)
4. Have the [brainstorming session](/docs/part-2/brainstorming.md)
5. Set up your [documentation](/docs/part-2/documentation-architecture.md)
6. Start executing with the [workflow](/docs/part-3/cline-workflow.md)

## Running & Deploying

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # local preview at http://localhost:5173
./deploy/deploy.sh     # build + push to nexus-1 (Hetzner), served by Caddy
```

## Real Example

The [VH Conference Toolkit](https://github.com/Visual-Hive/vh-conference-toolkit) was built using this methodology. Browse its repo to see thorough architecture docs, strict development rules, sprint-based task specs, and ADRs in action.

## Proof It Works

This methodology built [RISE](https://github.com/The-Low-Code-Foundation/rise) — an Electron desktop app — in 4 weeks for ~$400 in tokens. Production-ready, documented, maintainable.

## Status

Major update complete. Core methodology revised to reflect current best practices. Project templates and prompt library added.
