### Chapter 12b: The Project Control Panel ✅ COMPLETE

### Chapter 12c: The Frontend Tweaker ✅ COMPLETE

### Chapter 12f: Observability & Error Tracking ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `docs/part-5/observability.md`
**Status:** Written and published

A chapter teaching observability as a maturity model — what must be wired into the foundation (source-map upload and release tagging, both irreversible if missing), versus what can be deferred. Recommends PostHog as the consolidation (projects already use it for session replay), explicitly rejects Prometheus for application-error alerting, and provides a four-phase ladder (Foundation / Early / Pre-launch / Scale). The Foundation plumbing is baked into `.clinerules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `scripts/deploy.sh` as Sprint 1 defaults.

---

**File:** `docs/part-5/control-panel.md`
**Status:** Written and published

A chapter documenting the control panel pattern — a localhost admin dashboard that gives visibility into deployment health, data state, automation flows, and security in AI-coded projects. Based on real experience from OpsNest Sprint 3.

**Covers:**
- The Problem (black box backends)
- The Four Tabs: Deployment Centre, Data Browser, Automation Visualiser, Security & Testing
- Convention files and `.clinerules` rules
- When to build it (minimum viable vs full)
- OpsNest learnings

---

### Chapter 12d: Token Economics ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `docs/part-5/token-economics.md`
**Status:** Written and published. `.clineignore` template + Cost Hygiene Rules added to `.clinerules` / `CLAUDE.md` / `docs/part-6/templates.md`.

The cost-control chapter for AI-assisted development. Documents where token spend actually comes from (re-sent context per turn, not "AI thinking"), the four canonical leaks (open tabs, missing `.clineignore`, polling loops, sub-agent fan-out), and concrete patterns to keep cost predictable: `.clineignore`, hard stop after 3 failures, Plan-mode default, `new_task` for long sessions, max-requests-per-task circuit breaker, auto-approve OFF.

---

### Chapter 12e: Deployment & Platform Targets ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `docs/part-5/deployment-platforms.md`
**Status:** Written and published. Includes "The Non-Polling Deploy Pattern" section + build-on-server template (`project-templates/scripts/deploy.sh`, `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`) + Deploy Rules added to `.clinerules` / `CLAUDE.md` / `docs/part-6/templates.md`.

Covers Docker for local dev, Netlify/Vercel for static frontends, Hetzner for VPS production with strict dev/prod separation, Capacitor/PWA for mobile, Tauri/Electron for desktop, the SvelteKit cache-staleness trap, and — most importantly — the Non-Polling Deploy Pattern that prevented the OpsNest $30 polling-loop disaster from being repeatable.

---

### Chapter 12g: The Project Brain ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `docs/part-5/project-brain.md`
**Status:** Written and published.

A method-first chapter on keeping the human's mental model intact while an agent builds the app. Frames the loss of comprehension as a *comprehension* problem, not a documentation one, and fixes it by rendering the source of truth visually and keeping it live (the way n8n rendered the actual workflow graph). The core thesis is an inversion of low-code: instead of building visually so code falls out, the agent writes code and a visual model falls out. Covers the three-layer architecture (per-project MCP spine + `.brain/` data, thin per-agent enforcement adapter, standalone viewer), the authored-vs-derived principle (structural views derived from OpenAPI/migrations/graph exports so they can't drift; only narrative is authored), the context flywheel (the same brain is queryable by the agent via `query_context`), soft-vs-hard enforcement (recommend soft-first), and the distribution story (add an MCP, install a plugin, run a viewer — no forking the agent). Includes a placeholder link to the forthcoming reference implementation.

## Meta: Completing This Documentation

**Suggested Approach:**

1. Create new Cline chat
2. Load this outline
3. For each chapter:
   ```
   You: "Can we please write Chapter X based on the outline?
        Reference the completed chapters for style/format.
        Include TLDR, all sections, examples, and templates."
   ```
4. Review output
5. Move to outputs directory
6. Repeat for next chapter

**Estimated Effort:**
- Each chapter: 30-60 minutes
- Total: 15-20 hours over 1-2 weeks
