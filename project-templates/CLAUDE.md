# Project: [Project Name]
# Phase: [MVP / v1.0 / Production]

## Before EVERY Task

Read these files first:
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design and schema
2. `README.md` — project scope and current phase
3. `LEARNINGS.md` — known gotchas and solutions
4. `~/.cline/GLOBAL_MEMORY.md` — user preferences and universal rules
5. Current sprint plan in `dev-docs/sprints/`

Then query project memory (if MCP memory server is available):
6. `memory_check_patterns` — any repeated failures in this task area?
7. `memory_query_solutions` — any relevant prior solutions for this task's tags?
8. If `memory_check_patterns` returns 2+ failures in the same area → STOP. Suggest a self-audit before proceeding. The problem may be in the instructions, not the code.

## Iron-Clad Developer Rules

### Quality Standards
- **Unit tests are mandatory** — write tests for every piece of business logic, utility function, and API endpoint
- **Smoke test after every change** — run the app and verify end-to-end after any development, debugging, or fix
- **Browser/UI testing required** — for frontend changes, verify visually. Describe expected state and confirm.
- **Handle errors explicitly** — no silent failures, no empty catch blocks
- **Comment the "why"** — every non-obvious decision gets a comment explaining WHY
- **Every function gets a docstring** — parameters, return type, purpose

### Development Workflow
- **Plan mode FIRST** — use `plan` mode or propose an approach before writing code
- **One task at a time** — don't work on side issues. Document them for a separate task.
- **Commit working code** — never commit if tests fail
- **Update docs after every task** — LEARNINGS.md for gotchas (only entries that pass the 30-minute test), sprint plan status, ARCHITECTURE.md if structure changed
- **Ask questions when anything is unclear** — if a task spec is ambiguous or a requirement contradicts the architecture, ask before building
- **Never start serious development without a task document** — small bug fixes (2-3) in plan mode are acceptable, but substantial work must have a task doc first. Document all fixes in LEARNINGS.md or as an annex to the relevant task doc.
- **Handle API timeout errors gracefully** — if file writes time out, break the task into smaller chunks (e.g., write CSS first, then HTML body in sections, then footer)

### Architecture Rules
- **Follow existing patterns** — check the codebase before inventing new patterns
- **No new dependencies without justification** — explain why any new package is needed
- **Use project import aliases** — no deep relative imports across module boundaries
- **Database changes need migrations** — always use migration files for schema changes

### Live Project Overview Conventions

- **Read `overview/README.md` at the start of every task.** It's small (~1 page). It's your map of the current state.
- **Read additional `overview/*.md` files only when the task touches them.** Adding a route? Read `routes.md`. Adding an entity? Read `entities.md`. Do NOT read all overview files — be selective.
- **Update `domain.config.js` whenever entities change.** Adding a field, a relationship, a new entity — change it there, not just in code.
- **Add a JSDoc one-line description to every new route file** (`+page.server.ts`, `+server.ts`). The generator reads these.
- **Append a decision stub to `overview/decisions/` whenever you make a non-obvious call.** Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md`, three lines: what changed, why, alternatives considered.
- **Run `pnpm generate:overview` as the last step before committing.** Commit the regenerated folder. PR diffs surface drift.
- **If `overview/DRIFT.md` exists, READ IT before doing anything else** — it means current code disagrees with `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the situation needs human attention before further work.

### Cost Hygiene Rules

- **A `.clineignore` file MUST exist at project root** with `node_modules/`, build outputs, lockfiles, `.env*`, large doc folders, and binary asset folders excluded. See [Token Economics](/part-5/token-economics) for the canonical list.
- **Hard stop after 3 failures.** If the same operation fails three times, STOP. Report what's been tried, what failed, and what's confusing. Do not attempt a fourth time without human input.
- **Stay in Plan mode for exploratory work.** Switch to Act only when the approach is genuinely clear. "Just try it and see" means stay in Plan.
- **Use `new_task` to hand off long sessions.** When a task is past 50 turns and context is degrading, spawn a fresh task preloaded with structured state instead of letting the conversation grow indefinitely.
- **Never poll a long-running operation.** For deploys, builds, migrations: kick off the operation, return immediately, give the human a one-line command to check status. Polling on flaky networks burns dollars per minute. See [Deployment & Platform Targets](/part-5/deployment-platforms).
- **Auto-approve commands MUST stay OFF.** The human reviews every terminal command before it runs.

### Deploy Rules (any project that ships to a server)

- **Build on the server, never on AI's machine.** AI's deploy command is a single SSH that triggers `scripts/deploy.sh` (or equivalent) on the server, then exits. AI does not watch the build.
- **Return immediately after kicking off the deploy.** Once the SSH command completes, AI's job for this turn is DONE. Do not poll for build status. Do not run `pm2 logs` in a loop. Do not check the health endpoint until the human asks for it.
- **Hand the human a one-line status command.** After every deploy, output: "Deploy kicked off. To check: `pm2 logs <app> --lines 50`" or `curl <health-url>`.
- **Set `max_requests_per_task` to 10 for any deploy task.** Hard circuit breaker against polling-loop failures.
- **NEVER overwrite production `.env`.** Append new vars to `.env.example` with a description; notify the human to update production manually.
- **Push to dev only.** Production promotion is a human action.
- **Maintain `deployment.json` at project root.** List every service, its URL, its `/api/health` endpoint, and its deploy method.
- **Every deploy is a clean build.** `rm -rf .svelte-kit build && npm run build` is the default.
- **Prune Docker images after every registry-pull deploy.** Run `docker image prune -f` immediately after `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`. Old images are never removed automatically — they accumulate silently and will eventually fill the server disk. See [Docker Image Cleanup](/part-5/deployment-platforms#docker-image-cleanup-the-silent-disk-killer).
- **Check server disk space before every deploy.** Run `docker system df` and `df -h /`. If disk usage is above 80%, run `docker system prune -f --filter "until=72h"` before pulling new images.
- **A weekly Docker cleanup cron MUST be configured on every server running Docker deploys.** Verify `/etc/cron.d/docker-cleanup` (or equivalent) exists: `0 3 * * 0 root docker system prune -f --filter "until=168h" >> /var/log/docker-prune.log 2>&1`

### Deploy Verification — MANDATORY

#### Before declaring "ready to deploy":
1. Verify push: `git log origin/[MAIN_BRANCH]..HEAD` must be empty
2. Verify CI build: `gh run list --branch [MAIN_BRANCH] -L 3` — must show green ✅ for affected service
3. If CI build hasn't triggered (paths filter didn't match), warn: "⚠ No build triggered — file not in CI build paths. Consider `workflow_dispatch` to force a build."

#### After ANY production deployment:
1. Check `/api/build-info` to confirm new code is running:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://[DOMAIN]/api/build-info | jq .
   ```
2. Compare the returned `git_sha` with the commit you pushed. They must match.
3. **Never declare "deploy is done" without verification output.**
4. If verification fails (SHA mismatch, endpoint 404, or old code still running):
   ```
   ❌ Deploy verification FAILED — code not live. SHA expected: XXX, got: YYY
   ```
5. If build-info endpoint returns `git_sha: "unknown"`, the image was built before build-info was added. Tell the human to trigger a fresh CI build.

#### Image tag awareness:
- Know which tag your production environment pulls (`:latest`, `:dev`, `:sha-XXXXXXX`)
- Know which tag your CI pushes on which branch
- If these don't match, the deploy will silently pull old code
- **NEVER change `.env.production` to use a tag your CI doesn't push**

### Control Panel Conventions (if project has a backend)

**Deployment monitoring:**
- Maintain `deployment.json` at project root listing all services, health endpoints, and deploy methods
- Update it whenever a service is added, removed, or its URL changes
- Implement `/api/health` returning `{ status: 'ok', timestamp: '...' }`

**Data visibility:**
- When creating enum-like data or option sets, create a JSON file in `static-data/` first
- The control panel reads these files — check there before inventing dropdown values in code

**Automation flows:**
- Every backend automation (webhook, cron, pipeline) MUST have:
  1. A `@flow` JSDoc annotation declaring name, trigger, and steps
  2. An entry in the flow registry file
  3. `flowLog()` calls at each logical step with sanitised input/output
- `flowLog()` MUST NEVER include passwords, tokens, API keys, or raw JWTs
- `flowLog()` MUST NEVER crash the actual flow — always wrap in try/catch

**User journey testing:**
- After implementing any user-facing feature, append a test journey to `USER_JOURNEYS.json`
- Include: journey name, user role, exact steps, exact expected outcomes
- The control panel renders these as interactive pass/fail checklists

**Security checks:**
- When referencing env var names in monitoring/check code, ALWAYS read `.env.example` first — never invent names from conventions
- All admin routes must have auth guards
- All API routes (except public webhooks) must verify authentication
- Error responses must not leak stack traces

### Observability (Sprint 1 defaults — non-negotiable)

These are Foundation-phase items. Wire them in Sprint 1 even for a prototype.
You do NOT need to build dashboards or alerts yet — only the plumbing.

1. **Enable error capture** in the existing analytics SDK. For PostHog, set
   `capture_exceptions` in `posthog.init(...)`. Do not add a second error vendor
   (Sentry) unless ARCHITECTURE.md explicitly calls for a self-hosted tracker.

2. **Source maps are IRREVERSIBLE.** The deploy script MUST upload source maps to
   the error tracker at build time. A production error from a build whose maps were
   never uploaded cannot be de-minified later. Never skip this to "do it at launch."

3. **Release/version tagging is IRREVERSIBLE.** Every deploy MUST record a release
   identifier (version + commit SHA, plus build number for mobile). You cannot tag
   an error against a release that was never recorded.

4. **Split environments.** Tag every event with dev/staging/prod. Never let prod and
   dev errors land in the same bucket.

5. **Do NOT use Prometheus/Grafana for application-error alerting.** That is infra
   monitoring — a different axis. Application errors and alerts live in the error
   tracker. Infra/uptime monitoring, if any, is a separate, later concern.

6. **When an error fires, investigate before guessing.** Use the error tracker's
   grouped issue (PostHog MCP server) to read the real stack trace. Do not invent
   a cause from the minified message.

7. **Update the Observability table in ARCHITECTURE.md** whenever you wire one of
   these items.

### Frontend Tweaker Conventions (all projects with a UI)

**Text management (i18n):**
- ALL user-facing text MUST use i18n translation keys — no hardcoded strings in components
- Use i18next (or framework equivalent: svelte-i18n, vue-i18n, next-intl)
- Set up i18n in Sprint 1 during project scaffolding, even for monolingual apps
- Keys MUST be hierarchical by page/feature: `dashboard.header.title`, `auth.login.submit_button`
- Never use generic keys like `text1`, `label2`, `btn_a`
- Interpolated variables use double braces: `"greeting": "Welcome back, {{name}}"`
- Pluralisation uses i18next suffix convention: `_one`, `_other`, `_zero`
- Locale files live in `src/locales/` (or framework convention path)

**Style tokens (@tweak annotations):**
- All tweakable visual properties MUST use CSS custom properties
- Every custom property that a user might want to adjust MUST have a `@tweak` annotation comment
- Annotation format: `/* @tweak [Label] | [type: color|range] | [optional: state, breakpoint] */`
- Properties requiring annotations: font sizes, colours, spacing (padding/margin), border radii, shadows, opacity, transition durations, hover/focus/disabled state values
- Group tokens hierarchically in a `design-tokens.css` or at the top of component files:
  - Brand tokens: `--brand-primary`, `--brand-dark`, `--brand-accent`
  - Semantic tokens: `--text-primary`, `--bg-surface`, `--border-default`
  - Component tokens: `--card-padding`, `--btn-font-size`, `--hero-title-color`
- Dark mode: define overrides in `.dark {}` with matching `@tweak` annotations suffixed "(dark mode)"
- Components MUST reference variables, never raw values, for any property that's annotated

**Link management:**
- All external URLs and internal navigation hrefs MUST reference `links.json`
- No hardcoded URLs in components — import from the config file
- Structure: group by purpose (`social`, `cta`, `footer`, `legal`)
- Update `links.json` when adding or changing any link destination

**SEO and meta content:**
- All page titles, meta descriptions, and OG image paths MUST reference `meta.json`
- No hardcoded `<title>` or `<meta>` tags in page components
- Structure: one key per page/route with `title`, `description`, and optional `og_image`
- Meta descriptions should target 150-160 characters

**Convention file maintenance:**
- When adding a new page: update `meta.json`, add i18n keys for all text, add links to `links.json`
- When adding a new component: add `@tweak` annotations for all visual properties, add i18n keys for all text
- When modifying an existing component: ensure all four convention layers are updated in the same task
- NEVER leave orphaned keys in convention files after removing a component

### Prohibited
- Do NOT skip tests
- Do NOT refactor outside current task scope
- Do NOT add unspecified features
- Do NOT use `any` types or skip type safety
- Do NOT store secrets in code
- Do NOT ignore linter warnings
- Do NOT install dependencies without first searching the web for the latest stable version
- Do NOT overwrite production `.env` files with local values
- Do NOT push code to the production stack directly — dev first, user promotes to prod manually
- Do NOT estimate how long tasks will take — AI time predictions are wildly inaccurate and misleading. A task that takes 30 minutes of focused AI-assisted work gets estimated at "2-3 days." Omit all time estimates from plans, task docs, and status updates.

### Git & Security Hygiene
- Set up `.gitignore` from the start and review it regularly — no API keys, SSH keys, `.env` files, or credentials in the repo
- When adding new env vars, update `.env.example` with the variable name and a description (not the secret)
- Before any git push, verify `.gitignore` covers all sensitive files

### Project Memory & Self-Improvement

**LEARNINGS.md hygiene:**
- Apply the **30-minute test** before adding entries: "Would a fresh session waste 30+ minutes without this?" If no, don't add it.
- Maximum ~30 active entries. When approaching the limit, suggest graduating resolved entries to the MCP memory database.
- Do NOT add general observations, progress updates, task completion notes, or architectural decisions.
- If an entry describes a pattern that should become a permanent rule → suggest adding it to `CLAUDE.md` instead.

**Session end protocol (if MCP memory server is available):**
- At the end of every session, call `memory_store_session` with: task reference (or "ad-hoc: [description]" for spontaneous work), summary, outcome (completed/partial/failed), files touched, errors encountered, approaches tried.
- If any reusable solutions were discovered → call `memory_store_solution` with problem, solution, root cause, and tags.
- If the session discovered something that applies to ALL projects → call `memory_global_store`.
- If a LEARNINGS.md entry was resolved → suggest graduating it to warm storage.

**Self-audit triggers:**
- If `memory_check_patterns` shows 2+ sessions failed in the same code area → suggest self-audit before proceeding.
- If the same error has appeared in 3+ sessions → suggest self-audit.
- If a solution was applied but the problem recurred → suggest self-audit.
- **Self-audit means:** Review `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LEARNINGS.md`, and prior session solutions. The problem may be in the instructions, not the code. Report findings and suggest updates to rules/docs before retrying the fix.

**Document lifecycle:**
- When a sprint is completed, suggest running `memory_archive_sprint` to move completed task docs to cold storage and clean the dev-docs folder.
- Only the active sprint's materials should remain as markdown files in the repo.

## Observability

This project tracks errors in [PostHog | other]. Observability is a maturity model:
wire the Foundation plumbing (error capture, source-map upload, release tagging,
environment split) in Sprint 1 — these are cheap and the source-map/release items
are irreversible if skipped. Defer alerting, replay-linking, and infra monitoring
until there are real users. See ARCHITECTURE.md → Observability for the current
level, and Part V → Observability in the methodology guide for the full reasoning.

## Confidence Scoring

After each task:

```
## Confidence: X/10

**Met:**
- [x] [Criterion]

**Deferred:**
- [ ] [Thing] → [Phase]

**Tests:**
- Unit: [X/Y passing]
- Smoke: [Verified / Not verified]
```

**8/10 minimum to proceed.**

## Ask Human When

- Security decisions
- Architectural changes not in spec
- Ambiguous requirements
- Anything destructive
- Confidence below 8
- Task taking much longer than estimated
- Discovered issue affects another part of the app

## Tech-Specific Rules

### SvelteKit (if applicable)
- After ANY code change, run `npm run build` and check for build errors before declaring the task complete
- If build artifacts seem stale, run `rm -rf .svelte-kit && npm run build` for a clean rebuild
- When modifying shared utilities, layouts, or server load functions, test ALL pages that could be affected — not just the page you worked on
- Guard all browser-only APIs (`window`, `document`, `localStorage`) with `if (browser)` from `$app/environment`
- If a page throws a 500, check the server terminal — the actual error is there, not in the browser
- Deploy builds must always clean first: `rm -rf .svelte-kit build && npm run build`
- Every project needs `hooks.server.ts` with `Cache-Control: no-cache` on HTML responses and `immutable` on `/_app/immutable/` paths — this prevents stale deploys
- When setting up nginx, explicitly set cache headers: long cache for `/_app/immutable/`, no-cache for everything else
- Use `pm2 restart` not `pm2 reload` for SvelteKit deploys
- If the project doesn't use service workers intentionally, add the cleanup snippet to `+layout.svelte` onMount
- Include a visible build version (timestamp or commit hash) in the app footer or console

### Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (if applicable)
- After any schema migration on the dev server, ALWAYS run the seed script
- Include the seed command in the deployment checklist: migrations → seed → verify
- Use upsert logic in seed scripts rather than truncate-and-reinsert
