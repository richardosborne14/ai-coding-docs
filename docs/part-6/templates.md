# Project Templates

Drop these files into any repo and AI will know how to build your project. Each template is ready to customize — fill in the brackets, adjust the rules to your stack, and go.

**Quick start:** Copy the entire `project-templates/` directory from this repo into your project root. Customize each file. Point Cline or Claude Code at it and start working.

## What's Included

| File | Purpose | Customize? |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **README.md** | Project overview, vision, scope, tech stack, setup | Yes — fill in your project details |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | System design, DB schemas, components, API, deployment | Yes — critical to get right |
| **LEARNINGS.md** | Empty log for solutions and gotchas | Minimal — just start using it |
| **.clinerules** | Quality rules for Cline (VS Code) | Yes — add tech-specific rules |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Quality rules for Claude Code (CLI) | Yes — same content as .clinerules |
| **GLOBAL_MEMORY.md** | User preferences and universal rules (cross-project) — lives at `~/.cline/` | Yes — fill in your preferences |
| **TASK_TEMPLATE.md** | Format for individual task specifications | Light customization |
| **SPRINT_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md** | Format for sprint planning documents | Light customization |
| **SPRINT_RULES.md** | Rules for sizing sprints, writing tasks, managing scope | Review and adjust |
| **convention-files/** | Frontend Tweaker starter files (design tokens, i18n, links, meta) | Yes — adjust to your stack |
| **overview/** | Live Project Overview folder — generated, committed, AI reads selectively | Run `pnpm generate:overview` to populate |
| **scripts/generate-overview.js** | Generator that builds `overview/` from `package.json`, `domain.config.js`, route scan, flow registry | Customise paths if your project layout differs |
| **domain.config.js** | Declarative entity definitions feeding `overview/entities.md` | Yes — declare your real entities |
| **.clineignore** | Paths Cline excludes from context — saves 20-30% per turn | Yes — add project-specific paths |
| **scripts/deploy.sh** | Build-on-server deploy script — runs on the server, not on AI's machine | Yes — set `APP_DIR`, `PM2_NAME`, `BRANCH` |
| **Dockerfile** | Multi-stage Node Dockerfile with `/api/health` healthcheck | Adjust runtime command for your framework |
| **.dockerignore** | Keeps the Docker build context small and secret-free | Light customization |




### Prompt Templates

| File | When to Use |
|------|------------|
| **prompts/01-initial-brainstorm.md** | Starting a new project (Claude Opus, in a Project) |
| **prompts/02-generate-foundation-docs.md** | After brainstorming — generate all docs at once |
| **prompts/03-generate-task-docs.md** | Generate individual task specs for a sprint |
| **prompts/04-new-feature-brainstorm.md** | Adding features to an existing project |
| **prompts/05-fix-and-debug.md** | Debugging workflow with the 30-minute rule |
| **prompts/06-context-rescue.md** | When to start fresh and how to hand off context |
| **prompts/07-phase-audit.md** | Code review after completing a phase |

---

## How to Use These

### For a Brand New Project

1. **Brainstorm first** — Use `prompts/01-initial-brainstorm.md` in Claude (Opus, in a Project)
2. **Generate docs** — Use `prompts/02-generate-foundation-docs.md` to have Claude fill in all templates based on your brainstorming conversation
3. **Review and adjust** — Claude generates good first drafts, but review everything. Push back on vague schemas, weak rules, oversized sprints.
4. **Generate task specs** — Use `prompts/03-generate-task-docs.md` for detailed task documents
5. **Push to GitHub** — Add all docs and any starter code to your repo
6. **Start executing** — Point Cline or Claude Code at the repo and start with Task 1

### For an Existing Project

1. Add the templates you're missing (especially ARCHITECTURE.md and .clinerules/CLAUDE.md)
2. Fill them in based on your current codebase
3. Create a sprint plan for your next batch of work
4. Start using the task-per-conversation workflow

### .clinerules / CLAUDE.md (Key Sections)

```markdown
## Iron-Clad Developer Rules

### Quality Standards
- Unit tests mandatory for all business logic
- Smoke test after every change
- Browser testing for UI changes
- Assume authenticated session exists — navigate to the target URL, not the login page. The human uses Cline's remote browser connection to preserve login state. Only authenticate if bounced. Log out explicitly for signup/onboarding tests.
- Handle errors explicitly — no silent failures
- Comment the "why" on non-obvious decisions
- Every function gets a docstring

### Development Workflow
- Plan mode FIRST — always
- One task at a time — no side quests
- Commit working code only
- Update docs after every task

### Prohibited
- Do NOT skip tests
- Do NOT refactor outside current task scope
- Do NOT add unspecified features
- Do NOT use `any` types

### Confidence Scoring
After each task: rate 1-10, 8 minimum to proceed.

### Ask Human When
- Security decisions
- Architectural changes
- Ambiguous requirements
- Confidence below 8

### Live Project Overview Conventions (all projects)
[Read `overview/README.md` at task start, update `domain.config.js` on entity changes, JSDoc all routes, append decision stubs, run `pnpm generate:overview` before commit]
[See The Live Project Overview](/part-2/live-project-overview) for the full rules]

### Cost Hygiene Rules (all projects)
[`.clineignore` mandatory, hard stop after 3 failures, Plan-mode default, `new_task` for long sessions, never poll long-running operations, auto-approve OFF]
[See Token Economics](/part-5/token-economics) for the full rules]

### Deploy Rules (any project that ships to a server)
[Build on the server not on AI's machine, return immediately after kicking off, hand the human a one-line status command, `max_requests_per_task` cap, never overwrite production `.env`, dev only, `deployment.json` mandatory, every deploy is a clean build]
[See Deployment & Platform Targets](/part-5/deployment-platforms) for the full rules]

### Control Panel Conventions (if project has a backend)
[Deployment monitoring, automation flow annotations, user journey testing, security checks]
[See The Project Control Panel](/part-5/control-panel) for the full rules]

### Observability (Sprint 1 defaults — non-negotiable)
[7 rules: error capture, source maps (irreversible), release tagging (irreversible), environment split, no Prometheus for app errors, investigate before guessing, update ARCHITECTURE.md]
[See Observability & Error Tracking](/part-5/observability) for the full rules]

### Frontend Tweaker Conventions (all projects with a UI)
[i18n text management, @tweak style tokens, link management, SEO meta content]
[See The Frontend Tweaker](/part-5/frontend-tweaker) for the full rules]

### Accessibility Conventions (all projects with a UI) — non-negotiable
[Real elements not `<div onClick>`, never remove focus indicators, alt on every image, labels on every input, semantic headings and landmarks, never colour alone, 4.5:1 contrast, 24×24px targets, `prefers-reduced-motion`, focus moves on route change, a11y linter + axe-core before any UI task is complete, no overlay widgets]
[See Accessibility by Default](/part-5/accessibility) for the full rules]
```

## Real-World Example: VH Conference Toolkit

The [VH Conference Toolkit](https://github.com/Visual-Hive/vh-conference-toolkit) demonstrates these templates in production:

- Thorough architecture documentation with full schemas and component specifications
- Strict development rules with mandatory testing, prohibited behaviors, and tech-specific conventions
- Sprint-based task documentation with individual task specs and architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Each tool built as an independent, well-documented module following the same methodology

Browse the repo to see what thorough project documentation looks like.

## Tips

**Don't skip ARCHITECTURE.md.** It's the single most impactful document. AI with real schemas writes correct code on the first try. AI without them guesses and you spend hours debugging.

**Make .clinerules strict.** "Tests are mandatory" not "try to write tests." AI follows explicit rules. Vague suggestions get ignored.

**Review Claude's output.** When you use the prompts to generate these docs, Claude produces good first drafts. But review everything — push back on vague schemas, weak rules, and oversized sprints.

**Keep docs updated.** After every task, check: is ARCHITECTURE.md still accurate? Is LEARNINGS.md up to date? Stale docs cause stale output.
