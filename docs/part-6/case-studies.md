# Case Studies

Real examples showing the methodology in practice.

---

## RISE: Desktop Application

**Project:** Desktop app for low-code AI-assisted development
**Complexity:** High (Electron, multi-process, webpack)
**Result:** Production-ready in 4 weeks, ~$400 tokens

### What Made It Work

**1. MVP scoping saved weeks**

Full vision included: visual code editor, AI code generation, template marketplace, cloud sync, team collaboration.

MVP scope: Project scaffolding with AI assistance. One core feature.

The brainstorming session cut 80% of features. Those features are still documented for v1.0—but MVP shipped.

**2. Documentation handled Electron complexity**

Electron apps have:
- Main process
- Renderer process
- IPC between them
- Webpack configuration
- Native module compatibility

CLAUDE_RULES included Electron-specific standards. LEARNINGS captured IPC gotchas. Each new task session started with full context.

**3. Confidence scoring caught integration issues**

Task 5 (IPC communication) initially scored 7/10—"works but timing feels fragile."

Pushed for fixes. Found race condition where renderer sent messages before main handler registered. Fixed before it became a nightmare.

**4. Phase audit found security gap**

Audit after MVP revealed: preload script exposed too much to renderer. Security risk.

Added to annex tasks. Fixed before any release.

### Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Timeline | 4 weeks |
| Token cost | ~$400 |
| Lines of code | ~15,000 |
| Tasks | 32 |
| Avg confidence | 8.2/10 |

## Simple Dashboard: Quick Win

**Project:** Internal metrics dashboard
**Complexity:** Low (React, Express, PostgreSQL)
**Result:** Working MVP in 1.5 weeks, ~$150 tokens

### What Happened

**Brainstorm output:**
- Core need: See key metrics in one place
- MVP: 5 charts, one database, manual refresh
- Deferred: Real-time updates, drill-downs, alerts

**Development:**
- Task 1: Project setup, database schema (Day 1)
- Task 2: API endpoints for each metric (Day 2-3)
- Task 3: React dashboard with charts (Day 4-5)
- Task 4: Polish and deploy (Day 6-7)

**Smooth because:**
- Small scope clearly defined
- Standard tech stack, no surprises
- Each task genuinely independent
- No complex state management

### Lessons

Simple projects don't need heavy process. But they still benefit from:
- Clear scope (prevents feature creep)
- Task structure (maintains focus)
- Confidence scoring (catches issues)

Overhead: Maybe 2 hours of documentation. Time saved: Unknown bugs not shipped.

## Complex Refactor: Large Codebase

**Project:** Modernize legacy Node.js backend
**Complexity:** High (existing 50k lines, many dependencies)
**Result:** Clean migration in 8 weeks, ~$600 tokens

### The Challenge

Existing codebase:
- 50,000 lines of JavaScript
- Callbacks everywhere (pre-async/await)
- No tests
- Minimal documentation
- Multiple undocumented integrations

### How Methodology Helped

**1. Brainstorming defined scope**

Not "rewrite everything." Instead: "Modernize auth module first. If that works, continue. If not, reconsider."

**2. Documentation became discovery**

Creating CLAUDE_RULES forced documenting existing patterns. Creating ROADMAP required understanding dependencies. Documentation phase revealed hidden complexity.

**3. Task structure made it manageable**

```
Phase 1: Auth module (8 tasks)
Phase 2: User module (6 tasks)
Phase 3: API routes (10 tasks)
Phase 4: Integration (4 tasks)
```

Each task: Touch one module. Keep everything else working.

**4. Phase audits verified compatibility**

After each module, audit checked:
- Old tests still pass (compatibility)
- New code meets standards
- No regressions introduced

### Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Timeline | 8 weeks |
| Token cost | ~$600 |
| Lines modernized | ~30,000 |
| Tasks | 28 |
| Regressions caught | 12 (all in audit) |

## Failed Project: Learning Experience

**Project:** Real-time collaboration tool
**What happened:** Abandoned after 3 weeks and $500
**Why it failed:** Methodology was skipped

### The Mistakes

**1. No brainstorming**

Jumped straight to: "Build real-time collaborative editor."

Should have asked: "What's the MVP? Can we validate with something simpler?"

**2. No documentation**

"I'll add docs later." Later never came. Each session started confused.

**3. No confidence scoring**

"It works... mostly." Kept building on shaky foundation. Issues compounded.

**4. No phase audit**

By week 3, problems were everywhere. No clear path to fix them. Abandoned.

### What Would Have Helped

MVP scope: "Single-user editor first. Real-time sync after that works."

Documentation: Decisions captured, context preserved.

Confidence scoring: Stopped when foundation was shaky.

Phase audit: Issues caught before they multiplied.

### The Real Lesson

The methodology feels like overhead—until you skip it and watch a project fall apart.

## OpsNest Control Panel (Backend Visibility)

**Project:** Admin control panel for a SvelteKit + Directus membership portal
**Complexity:** Medium (9 tasks, 2-week sprint)
**What it demonstrates:** The "build observability tools early" pattern from [The Project Control Panel](/part-5/control-panel)

### The Setup

SvelteKit app on a Hetzner VPS, Directus CMS in Docker, n8n being migrated to SvelteKit API routes. The admin had no way to see deployment health, data state, automation flows, or security posture. Sprint 3 was a deliberate experiment: build the control panel, observe what the AI gets right and wrong, write the docs from real experience.

### What Was Built (9 Tasks)

1. Tabbed control panel shell at `/admin/control-panel`
2. Deployment centre: `deployment.json` + live health checks
3. Data browser: Directus schema introspection + paginated viewer
4. Data editing: inline cell editing + `static-data/` JSON files
5. Automation annotations: `@flow` JSDoc + `flowLog()` utility + `flow-registry.js`
6. Automation visualiser: step diagram with live status overlay
7. Security runner: 8 automated checks (env vars, auth guards, cookie settings)
8. User journey testing: interactive pass/fail checklists with bug report generator
9. `.clinerules` update: codified all conventions as rules for future AI sessions

### What It Caught

- **Stale deploy:** The deployment tab revealed Sprint 3 was never actually deployed. The new `/api/health` endpoint returned 404 on the live server.
- **Hallucinated env vars:** The security runner found `DIRECTUS_URL` used throughout monitoring code instead of `VITE_DIRECTUS_URL`. Looked correct. Passed code review. Failed at runtime.
- **Missing type narrowing:** The security checks exposed a pattern of unchecked assumptions that would have been invisible in normal testing.

**3 bugs caught by the control panel's own monitoring — none visible in code review.**

### Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Timeline | 2 weeks |
| Tasks | 9 |
| Token cost | ~$80 |
| Bugs caught by own monitoring | 3 |
| `.clinerules` rules added | 5 |

**The rule that came out of it:** "When writing any code that references env var names, ALWAYS read `.env.example` first. Never invent names from conventions." One rule, one entire class of hallucination prevented.

## The Eight-Gap Production Launch (Observability)

**Project:** Client web app approaching production launch
**Complexity:** Low (the fix was ~15 minutes of plumbing)
**What it demonstrates:** Why source-map upload and release tagging are Foundation items, not launch items

### The Setup

An app built fast for early testing. Approaching production launch, the client identified eight observability gaps — no error tracking, no source maps, no alerting, no grouping, no release tagging, no environment split, no session replay link, no native crash reporting. The instinct was to treat this as eight projects to tackle before launch.

### The Honest Framing

Most of the eight didn't matter during prototyping — and that's exactly why they were never set up. Error alerting, session replay linking, grouping tuning — all of that is genuinely skippable while you're iterating with five test users.

### The Bite

Two of them were the kind you can't fix after the fact. Source maps from the builds already shipped were never captured — every production error was `a.b.c is not a function at vm:1:12345`, permanently. Release tags were never recorded at deploy time, so there was no way to say "this bug started after which deploy."

### The Fix

Switch on PostHog error tracking (already present for session replay), wire source-map upload + release tagging into the deploy script, split environments. About 15 minutes of plumbing that should have been Sprint 1.

### Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Observability gaps found at launch | 8 |
| Irreversible (couldn't be fixed retroactively) | 2 |
| Foundation plumbing setup cost (had it been Sprint 1) | ~15 min |
| Builds shipped with undebuggable stack traces | [multiple weeks of builds] |

**The principle:** Separate the plumbing from the dashboard. The plumbing is cheap, reversible, and irreversible if *missing*. The dashboard is optional attention you can always switch on later. See [Observability & Error Tracking](/part-5/observability) for the full maturity model.

## Patterns Across Projects

**What consistently works:**
- Brainstorming cuts scope dramatically
- Documentation prevents context loss
- Confidence scoring catches issues early
- Phase audits find accumulated problems
- New chat per task keeps AI focused

**What varies by project:**
- Documentation depth (simple vs complex projects)
- Task granularity (small vs large codebase)
- Audit frequency (stable vs risky changes)

**Universal truth:**
30 minutes of planning saves days of rework. Every time.
